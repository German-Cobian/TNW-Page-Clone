# TNW-Page-Clone

This project consists of a reproduction of the TNW homepage. It displays the text, images and video of the original on the given day. Advertisements and many of the interactive elements have been left out.

In this project we implemented HTML tags, CSS and its associated tools (such as flex-box, floats and grid) to properly give position and style to the diferent elements and sections of the page and make it look as similiar as possible to the original article page. We also worked with media queries to make it responsive.
